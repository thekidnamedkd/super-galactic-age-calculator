# _SUPER GALACTIC AGE CALCULATOR_

#### _Week 5 Independent Project_

#### By _Kevin Davis_

## Description

_A human year, our measure of age, is based on the Earth's orbit of 365 days around the Sun. For some planets this orbit is much smaller or much bigger, meaning the number days in that planet's year are smaller or bigger. This means many more or many less years (solar orbits) could have occurred in the same number of days you have been alive on Earth. Enter your Earth age to find your Galactic age on any planet in our solar system._

### Specs
| Spec | Input | Output | Check |
| :---------- | :---------- | :---------- | :-----------: |
| The program should create a class for the user. | <strong>input:</strong>| <strong>output:</strong> N/A | [X] |
| The program should take an integer number as "age" (based on solar Earth years) and save it to the user class. | <strong>input:</strong> 30 | <strong>output:</strong> N/A | [X] |
| The program should take ano integer value for "life expectancy"(based on solar Earth years) and save it to the user class. | <strong>input:</strong> 75 | <strong>output:</strong> N/A | [X] |
| The program should create a planet class to store the constant of each planet as a relation of solar orbits to earth. | <strong>input:</strong> 88/365 = .24 (Mercury) | <strong>output:</strong> N/A | [X] |
| The program should calculate the user age as a conversion for each planet in the planet class. | <strong>input:</strong> Mercury age | <strong>output:</strong> (30/.24) = 125 | [X] |
| The program should calculate how many years a person has left (+integer) or has over-lived (-integer) on the calculation of input "life expectancy" - calculated "[planet] years". | <strong>input:</strong> 75 | <strong>output:</strong> 75 - 125 = -50 (Mercury) //or// 75 - 2.5 = 72.5 (Jupiter) | [X] |
