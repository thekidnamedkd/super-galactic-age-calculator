# _SUPER GALACTIC AGE CALCULATOR_

#### _Week 5 Independent Project_

#### By _Kevin Davis_

## Description

_A human year, our measure of age, is based on the Earth's orbit of 365 days around the Sun. For some planets this orbit is much smaller or much bigger, meaning the number days in that planet's year are smaller or bigger. This means many more or many less years (solar orbits) could have occurred in the same number of days you have been alive on Earth. Enter your Earth age to find your Galactic age on any planet in our solar system._

### Specs
| Spec | Input | Output |
| :---------- | :---------- | :---------- |
| When the user inputs their age based on a birthday, the program should calculate for number of days they been alive | <strong>input:</strong> Nov. 25 1989 | <strong>output:</strong> "On Earth you are 30 years or 11, 171 days." | 
| The program should save the number of days from the input to an object for the user, then calculate an age for the alotted planets in corresponding years. | <strong>input:</strong> Nov. 25 1989 | <strong>output:</strong> "On Mercury you are... X years" |
| When the user inputs their average life expectancy (based on solar Earth years) in addition to their birthday, the program should calculate how many years a person has left or has over lived on other planets solar years. | <strong>input:</strong> 75 years | <strong>output:</strong> On Mercury you have outlived your life expectancy by 52 years. On Jupiter you are expected to live another 72 years |
